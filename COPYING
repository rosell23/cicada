           CICADA END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
                     The Cicada Project
                         25/10/25

This is the Cicada End-User License Agreement, version 0.1, as defined by
the Cicada Project.

Usage of terms such as SHALL, MAY, and SHOULD follows the definitions in
RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

== 0.1. Manifesto & Preamble ==

Most end-user license agreements attempt to restrict users to controlled ecosystems,
keeping them dependent on corporate interests. In contrast, the Cicada EULA is
designed to ensure autonomy, transparency, and freedom.

Individuals worldwide use the Cicada EULA to keep software free—once again.

	When we refer to “free”, we mean freedom, not price.

== 0.2. Definitions ==

* “EULA” refers to this document.  
* “Terms” refers to the terms specified by the EULA.  
* “Work” refers to any material, software, or documentation covered by this EULA.  
* “Sources” refers to the human-readable files from which Binaries are built.  
* “Binaries” refers to pre-built, machine-readable forms of the Sources.  
* “Compatible license” refers to any license that grants freedoms equal to or
  greater than those in this EULA.  
* “Unauthorized Usage” refers to any use of the Work that violates these Terms,
  including but not limited to commercial exploitation, as defined in section
  1.4.
* “Copyright”  refers to rights recognized by applicable jurisdictions
  protecting Works against Unauthorized Usage.  
* “Commercial usage” means any use, sale, hosting, or service involving
  financial profit, remuneration, or benefit by for-profit organizations,
  directly or indirectly.
* “Larger Work” refers to a work that combines the Work with other material,
  where the original is identifiable and separable from the extension.
* “You” refers to you, an user, as a legal entity agreeing with these Terms.

== TERMS AND CONDITIONS ==

== 1.1. Conveying Verbatim Copies ==

You MAY distribute verbatim copies of the Sources, provided that:  
  * You retain all copyright notices and references to this EULA.  
  * You provide recipients with a copy of this EULA.  
  * You do not misrepresent the authorship or origin of the Work.  

== 1.2. Modifications and Derivative Works ==

You MAY modify the Sources and create Derivative Works, provided that:  
  * Each modified Source File is kept under the EULA.
  * Clear notice of modifications and the date of change SHALL be kept.
  * Attribution to the original authors MUST be preserved.
  * You MAY distribute or incorporate the Work within a Larger Work,
    as long as:
	+ these Terms continues to apply to all original and modified Source
	  Files derived from the Work
	+ the Larger Work does not, by mere combination, adapt these Terms.

== 1.3. Redistribution and Binaries ==

If you distribute Binaries:  
  * You MUST make the corresponding Sources easily available. 
  * You MUST include a copy of this EULA verbatim with your distribution.  
  * You MUST NOT impose any new restrictions that limit the end user’s
    rights and freedoms granted herein. 

== 1.4. Restrictions on Commercial Usage ==

The Work is provided primarily for individual use, education, research, and non-profit purposes.

You MAY incorporate the Work in a service or product that generates incidental
revenue (e.g., via donations or crowdfunding), as long as the Work itself is not
the primary source of income.

Use of the Work as a main source of profit—such as by selling it, licensing it,
or making it a central component of a for-profit product or service--constitutes
unauthorized commercial exploitation.

Organizations wishing to commercially exploit the Work may contact the original
authors or maintainers to obtain a separate commercial license.

== 1.5. Termination and Liability ==

Failure to comply with the Terms will result in termination.  
If you haven't fixed the violations within a margin of 30 days, you MUST cease
all use of the Work and take down any distributed copies.

Termination does not affect or void the copyright ownership of the Work, nor
rights of downstream recipients who have not violated these Terms remains
unaffected.

THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE WORK OR ITS USE.

== 1.6. Jurisdiction and Validity ==

This EULA is intended for worldwide applicability.  
Specific legal interpretations SHALL be guided by principles of international
copyright and fair use law.  
If any clause is found invalid, the remaining Terms SHALL remain in effect.
